Summary: Recent Website Updates

I've been trying to get a little practice at working with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/),
the technology this website is built with so I've added a few pages. I added
some galleries of my photography and a list of marathons I've run.  I roughly
styled the photo galleries, I'd like to make them a little nicer, but they
seem to display decent enough on desktop and mobile for now.  Anyway,
hopefully I'll be able to update with some other projects I've been working on
and with a little more frequency in the coming months. I have several things
I've been doing that I'd like to put on here for other people to learn from.
